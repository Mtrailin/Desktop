- Better error handling and logging

## 🚀 For You (Since You Have Coinbase API)

### Step 1: Add Your Credentials

Edit `.env` file:
```bash
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret_here
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup

```bash
python setup_coinbase.py
```

Expected output:
```

✓ API Key found
✓ API Secret found
✓ Successfully retrieved X account(s)
✓ Successfully retrieved X trading product(s)

```

### Step 3: See Your Data

```bash
python quick_start_coinbase.py

- Recent price movements

### Step 4: Start Trading

#### Option A: Use the GUI
```bash
python crypto_trader_gui.py
```

#### Option B: Use Python Code
```python
from exchange_manager import ExchangeManager
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

manager = ExchangeManager(
    'coinbase',
    api_key=os.getenv('COINBASE_API_KEY'),
    api_secret=os.getenv('COINBASE_API_SECRET')
)

# Get BTC/USD data
df = manager.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USD', '1h', limit=100)

# Check balance
balance = manager.fetch_balance()

# Place order (careful!)
# order = manager.create_market_order('BTC/USD', 'buy', cost=10)
```

## 💡 Tips

### Get Better Fees
- Higher trading volume = lower fees (check [Coinbase fee schedule](https://help.coinbase.com/en/advanced-trade/trading-and-funding/trading-fees))
- Maker orders typically cheaper than taker orders
- Use limit orders with `post_only=True` to guarantee maker fees

### Optimize Performance
- Use native SDK (automatic when credentials provided)
- Batch requests when possible
- Use WebSocket for real-time data (future enhancement)

### Safe Trading
- Start with small amounts
- Use limit orders for better control
- Always set stop losses
- Test strategies with backtesting first
- Monitor your bot regularly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "SDK not installed"
```bash
pip install coinbase-advanced-py
```

### Issue: "Invalid credentials"
- Check `.env` has correct values
- No extra spaces around `=`
- API key is active on Coinbase

### Issue: "Permission denied"
- API key needs permissions:
  - ✅ View account information
  - ✅ View market data
  - ✅ Trade (for orders)

### Issue: "Rate limit"
- Wait 1 minute
- SDK handles rate limiting automatically
- Reduce request frequency
